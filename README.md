## React Practice Projects

This project contains a collection of React practice projects that I've worked on to improve my skills and understanding of the framework.

## Projects

## Greeting Message

In this project, you learned about time and how to display a greeting message based on the current time. Using the **'Date()'** object, you obtained the current time and used conditional statements to determine the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening) and display an appropriate greeting message. You also learned how to update the greeting message in real-time using the **'setInterval()'** method.

## Event Listeners

In this project, you learned about event listeners in React and implemented a mouse hover and click event listener. Using the **'onMouseOver'** and **'onClick'** event listeners, you created a feature that changes the background color of a div when the user hovers over or clicks on it.

## UseStateCounter

In this project, you learned about the **'useState'** hook and created a counter that allows the user to add or subtract one number using buttons. You also learned how to update the **'state'** using the **'setState'** method and how to manage the previous state using the functional form of setState.

## Ternary Operator

In this project, you learned about the ternary operator in React and created a simple yes or no feature. Using conditional rendering with the ternary operator, you created a feature that displays **"Yes"** or **"No"** based on a boolean value.

## Toggle Favorite Card

In this project, you deepened your knowledge of **'useState'** and managing previous state changes through a toggle. You created a toggle favorite card feature that allows the user to add or remove a card from their favorites list by clicking a star icon.

## Box Challenges

In this project, you learned about using the **'.map'** method in React and how to manage **'state'**, and control **'previous data'**. The goal of the project was to create a feature that allows the user to select and deselect boxes with different color.

## Jokes Setup With Punchline

In this project, you created a feature that shows and hides a joke's punchline by clicking a button. You learned how to use the **'useState'** hook to manage component state and how to render dynamic data to the user interface.

To achieve this, you likely used a local data file that contained an array of jokes. You then used the **'useState'** hook to initialize the component state with the first joke in the array, and to store the punchline of the current joke. When the user clicked the button, you updated the component state to show the punchline of the current joke.

## React Forms

In this project, you learned about forms in React and how to use their features. You created a feature that allows the user to input data into a form and console log that data. You also learned how to update the state of the form using the **'useState'** hook.

## Making API Calls

In this project, you used the Marvel Characters API to create a feature that displays new Marvel characters with every click. You learned how to use the **'fetch'** API to retrieve data from a third-party API, and how to render dynamic data to the user interface. Additionally, you learned about the **'useEffect'** hook and how it can be used to manage component side effects, such as fetching data from an API.

To achieve this, you likely used the Marvel Characters API to fetch data about Marvel characters, and then used the **'useEffect'** hook to manage the state of the component that displays the characters data. With **'useEffect'**, you could ensure that the data is only fetched once when the component mounts, and that subsequent updates to the data are reflected in the component state.

Overall, this project helped you practice using the **'fetch'** API, rendering dynamic data to the user interface, and managing component side effects with the **'useEffect'** hook.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:

```bash

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd react-practice-projects
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies using a package manager like **'npm'** or **'yarn'**:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the application in your browser.
